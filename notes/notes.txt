Workflow File Tasks:
    testing your code
    sending a slack message
    publishing a package
    openeing an issue 
    deploying applications

Events:
  Repos events: push pullm request, issue
  external events: sending a POST request to a REST API
  Schedule Time:
  MAnually: pressing the run workflow button
Events are the triggers that start your workflows. These could be activities like pushing code to a repository, creating a pull request, or scheduling a time-based event. Some common events include:
    push: Triggered when code is pushed to a repository.
    pull_request: Triggered when a pull request is created or updated.
    schedule: Triggered based on a cron schedule.
    workflow_dispatch: Manually triggered by a user.


Runner MAchine:
  github hosted runners : win, linux, macos with tools installed
  self hosted runners: more customizable, more control over hardware, install packages.
  large runners: with more RAM & CPU

* JOB runs on the Runner MAchine
* JOBS can run parallel
* Actions are the individual tasks that make up your jobs
* also can schedule

YAML Format
    is superset of json
    * key: value
    * "key with quotes" : "value within quotes"     --> are permitted
    * special_chars: "special: characters"
    * excape characters --> "\u263A \u263B \n"    --> have to be in double quotes
    * array:
        - item1
        - item2
    * json array: [item1,item2]
    * numbers: 100
    * boolean: true/false
    * null =  null
    * also_null = ~
    
    * object (maps):
        key:value
        another: value
        nested_object:
            nested_key: value

    * json style object
    * sequence:
        - item1
        - item2
        - 0.5   --> numvber
        - key : value
          another_key: value
        - - nested array item
          - nested array item2
    * literal block: |
        first line

        second line
    * folded block: >
        first line
        second line
